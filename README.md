* Hi, this is my test project where i learned how to work with MVC, autolayout, storyboard and UserDefaults.

* I used:
    - MVC architecture
    - UIKit 
    - StoryBoard
    - Autolayout
    - UserDefaults
    - Segue 
    - Table view controllers 

* This is a game where you need to tap the numbers in the correct order until they all will disappear.
* It has settings that allow you to choose to play with timer or without it and also set the desired time on timer. All settings are saved in UserDefaults. 
* As well there is a view controller to see your current record in the game.
